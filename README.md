Temporal Super-Resolution using Multi-Channel Illumination Source
This Repo represents the 1D analysis for our TSR paper.

While sensing in high temporal resolution is necessary for wide range of application, it is still limited nowadays due to cameras sampling rate. In this work we try to increase the temporal resolution beyond the Nyquist frequency, which is limited by the sampling rate of the sensor. This work establishes a novel approach for Temporal-Super-Resolution that uses the object reflecting properties from an active illumination source to go beyond this limit. Following theoretical derivation, we demonstrate how we can increase the temporal spectral detected range by a factor of 6 and possibly even more. Our method is supported by simulations and experiments and we demonstrate as an application, how we use our method to improve in about factor two the accuracy of object motion estimation.
